##
# @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash,
#   GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
#   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This
#   parameter can be many types.
#   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented
#   keyfile for authenticating requests made by this client.
#   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the
#   construction of credentials for this client.
#   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the
#   construction of credentials for this client.
#   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
#   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The
#   channel credentials should already be composed with a
#   `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
#   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc
#   transforms the metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
# @param scope [String, Array<String>]
#   The OAuth scope (or scopes) for this service. This parameter is ignored if
#   an updater_proc is supplied.
# @param timeout [Numeric]
#   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
# @param metadata [Hash]
#   Default metadata to be sent with each request. This can be overridden on a
#   per call basis.
