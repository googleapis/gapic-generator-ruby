# Ruby Client for the <%= gem.title %> API

<%= gem.summary %>

<%= gem.description %>

Actual client classes for the various versions of this API are defined in
_versioned_ client gems, with names of the form `<%= gem.name %>-v*`.
The gem `<%= gem.name %>` is a convenience wrapper library that brings the
verisoned gems in as dependencies, and provides high-level methods for
constructing clients.

View the [Client Library Documentation](<%= gem.library_documentation_url %>)
for this library, <%= gem.name %>, to see the convenience methods for
constructing client objects. Reference documentation for the client objects
themselves can be found in the client library documentation for the versioned
client gems:
<%- last_index = gem.versioned_gems.size - 1 -%>
<%- gem.versioned_gems.each_with_index do |name, i| -%>
<%- sep = i == last_index ? "." : "," -%>
[<%= name %>](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/<%= name %>/latest)<%= sep %>
<%- end -%>

## Quick Start

```
$ gem install <%= gem.name %>
```

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
<%- if gem.free_tier? -%>
1. This API has a free tier. You may not need to
   [enable billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
   to get started.
<%- else -%>
1. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
<%- end -%>
<%- if gem.api_id -%>
1. [Enable the API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/<%= gem.api_id %>.googleapis.com)
<%- end -%>
1. {file:AUTHENTICATION.md Set up authentication.}

<%- if gem.migration? %>
## Migrating from <%= gem.pre_migration_version %> versions

The <%= gem.migration_version %> release of the <%= gem.name %> client is a significant upgrade
based on a [next-gen code generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-ruby),
and includes substantial interface changes. Existing code written for earlier
versions of this library will likely require updates to use this version.
See the {file:MIGRATING.md MIGRATING.md} document for more information.

<%- end -%>
## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest)
that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
