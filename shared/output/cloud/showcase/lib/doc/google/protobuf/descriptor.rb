    #     This is provided for backwards-compatibility with the MessageSet wire
    #     format.  You should not use this for any other reason:  It's less
    #     efficient, has fewer features, and is more complicated.

    #       }
    #     Note that the message cannot have any defined fields; MessageSets only
    #     have extensions.
    #
    #     All extensions of your type must be singular messages; e.g. they cannot
    #     be int32s, enums, or repeated messages.
    #
    #     Because this is an option, the above two restrictions are not enforced by
    #     the protocol compiler.
    # @!attribute [rw] no_standard_descriptor_accessor
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #     Disables the generation of the standard "descriptor()" accessor, which can

    # @!attribute [rw] deprecated
    #   @return [Boolean]

    #     this is a formalization for deprecating messages.
    # @!attribute [rw] map_entry
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #     Whether the message is an automatically generated map entry type for the
    #     maps field.
    #
    #     For maps fields:
    #         map<KeyType, ValueType> map_field = 1;
    #     The parsed descriptor looks like:
    #         message MapFieldEntry {
    #             option map_entry = true;
    #             optional KeyType key = 1;

    #         }

    #
    #     Implementations may choose not to generate the map_entry=true message, but
    #     use a native map in the target language to hold the keys and values.
    #     The reflection APIs in such implementions still need to work as
    #     if the field is a repeated message field.
    #
    #     NOTE: Do not set the option in .proto files. Always use the maps syntax
    #     instead. The option should only be implicitly set by the proto compiler
    #     parser.

    # @!attribute [rw] packed
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #     The packed option can be enabled for repeated primitive fields to enable
    #     a more efficient representation on the wire. Rather than repeatedly
    #     writing the tag and type for each element, the entire array is encoded as

    #     false will avoid using packed encoding.
    # @!attribute [rw] jstype

    #     (int64, uint64, sint64, fixed64, sfixed64).  A field with jstype JS_STRING
    #     is represented as JavaScript string, which avoids loss of precision that
    #     can happen when a large value is converted to a floating point JavaScript.
    #     Specifying JS_NUMBER for the jstype causes the generated JavaScript code to
    #     use the JavaScript "number" type.  The behavior of the default option
    #     JS_NORMAL is implementation dependent.
    #
    #     This option is an enum to permit additional types to be added, e.g.
    #     goog.math.Integer.
    # @!attribute [rw] lazy
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #     Should this field be parsed lazily?  Lazy applies only to message-type
    #     fields.  It means that when the outer message is initially parsed, the
    #     inner message's contents will not be parsed but instead stored in encoded
    #     form.  The inner message will actually be parsed when it is first accessed.
    #
    #     This is only a hint.  Implementations are free to choose whether to use
    #     eager or lazy parsing regardless of the value of this option.  However,
    #     setting this option true suggests that the protocol author believes that
    #     using lazy parsing on this field is worth the additional bookkeeping
    #     overhead typically needed to implement it.
    #
    #     This option does not affect the public interface of any generated code;
    #     all method signatures remain the same.  Furthermore, thread-safety of the
    #     interface is not affected by this option; const methods remain safe to
    #     call from multiple threads concurrently, while non-const methods continue
    #     to require exclusive access.
    #
    #
    #     Note that implementations may choose not to check required fields within
    #     a lazy sub-message.  That is, calling IsInitialized() on the outer message
    #     may return true even if the inner message has missing required fields.
    #     This is necessary because otherwise the inner message would have to be
    #     parsed in order to perform the check, defeating the purpose of lazy
    #     parsing.  An implementation which chooses not to check required fields
    #     must be consistent about it.  That is, for any particular sub-message, the
    #     implementation must either *always* check its required fields, or *never*
    #     check its required fields, regardless of whether or not the message has
    #     been parsed.

    #   @return [Google::Protobuf::SourceCodeInfo::Location]
    #     A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which
    #     corresponds to a particular definition.  This information is intended
    #     to be useful to IDEs, code indexers, documentation generators, and similar
    #     tools.
    #
    #     For example, say we have a file like:
    #       message Foo {
    #         optional string foo = 1;
    #       }
    #     Let's look at just the field definition:
    #       optional string foo = 1;
    #       ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^
    #       a       bc     de  f  ghi
    #     We have the following locations:
    #       span   path               represents
    #       [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.
    #       [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).
    #       [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).
    #       [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).
    #       [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).
    #
    #     Notes:
    #     - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any
    #       particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are
    #       logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire
    #       extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will
    #       have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated
    #       field without an index.
    #     - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single
    #       logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most
    #       obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple
    #       extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.
    #     - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For
    #       example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the
    #       beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within
    #       the block.
    #     - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span
    #       does not mean that it is a descendent.  For example, a "group" defines
    #       both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations
    #       corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.
    #     - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to
    #       ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could
    #       be recorded in the future.

      #
      #     Each element is a field number or an index.  They form a path from
      #     the root FileDescriptorProto to the place where the definition.  For
      #     example, this path:
      #       [ 4, 3, 2, 7, 1 ]
      #     refers to:
      #       file.message_type(3)  // 4, 3
      #           .field(7)         // 2, 7
      #           .name()           // 1
      #     This is because FileDescriptorProto.message_type has field number 4:
      #       repeated DescriptorProto message_type = 4;
      #     and DescriptorProto.field has field number 2:
      #       repeated FieldDescriptorProto field = 2;
      #     and FieldDescriptorProto.name has field number 1:
      #       optional string name = 1;
      #
      #     Thus, the above path gives the location of a field name.  If we removed
      #     the last element:
      #       [ 4, 3, 2, 7 ]
