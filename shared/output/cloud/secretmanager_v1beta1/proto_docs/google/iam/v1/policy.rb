module Google
  module Iam
    module V1
      # Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to
      # specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `Binding` binds a list of
      # `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,
      # Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions
      # defined by IAM.
      #
      # **Example**
      #
      #     \\\{
      #       "bindings": [
      #         \\\{
      #           "role": "roles/owner",
      #           "members": [
      #             "user:mike@example.com",
      #             "group:admins@example.com",
      #             "domain:google.com",
      #             "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com",
      #           ]
      #         \},
      #         \\\{
      #           "role": "roles/viewer",
      #           "members": ["user:sean@example.com"]
      #         \}
      #       ]
      #     \}
      #
      # For a description of IAM and its features, see the
      # [IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam).
      # @!attribute [rw] version
      #   @return [Integer]
      #     Version of the `Policy`. The default version is 0.
      # @!attribute [rw] bindings
      #   @return [Google::Iam::V1::Binding]
      #     Associates a list of `members` to a `role`.
      #     Multiple `bindings` must not be specified for the same `role`.
      #     `bindings` with no members will result in an error.
      # @!attribute [rw] etag
      #   @return [String]
      #     `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      #     prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
      #     It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
      #     read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      #     conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      #     systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
      #     ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
      #
      #     If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing
      #     policy is overwritten blindly.

      #        on the internet; with or without a Google account.
      #
      #     * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone
      #        who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
      #
      #     * `user:\\\{emailid\}`: An email address that represents a specific Google
      #        account. For example, `alice@gmail.com` or `joe@example.com`.
      #
      #
      #     * `serviceAccount:\\\{emailid\}`: An email address that represents a service
      #        account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
      #
      #     * `group:\\\{emailid\}`: An email address that represents a Google group.
      #        For example, `admins@example.com`.
      #
      #     * `domain:\\\{domain\}`: A Google Apps domain name that represents all the
      #        users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`.
