        # Parameters for a product search request.
        # @!attribute [rw] bounding_poly

        #     The bounding polygon around the area of interest in the image.
        #     Optional. If it is not specified, system discretion will be applied.
        # @!attribute [rw] product_set
        #   @return [String]
        #     The resource name of a [ProductSet][google.cloud.vision.v1.ProductSet] to
        #     be searched for similar images.

        #   @return [String]
        #     The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based
        #     on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value
        #     expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key.
        #
        #     For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND brand = Google" is
        #     acceptable, but not "(color = red OR brand = Google)" or "color: red".
