# Example demonstrating basic usage of
# So::Much::Trash::GarbageService::Client#long_running_garbage
#
def long_running_garbage
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = So::Much::Trash::GarbageService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = So::Much::Trash::LongRunningGarbageRequest.new

  # Call the long_running_garbage method.
  result = client.long_running_garbage request

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::Operation. You can use this
  # object to check the status of an operation, cancel it, or wait
  # for results. Here is how to block until completion:
  result.wait_until_done! timeout: 60
  if result.response?
    p result.response
  else
    puts "Error!"
