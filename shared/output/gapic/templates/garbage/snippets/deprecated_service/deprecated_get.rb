# Snippet for the deprecated_get call in the DeprecatedService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# So::Much::Trash::DeprecatedService::Client#deprecated_get.
#
def deprecated_get
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = So::Much::Trash::DeprecatedService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = So::Much::Trash::EmptyGarbage.new

  # Call the deprecated_get method.
  result = client.deprecated_get request

  # The returned object is of type So::Much::Trash::EmptyGarbage.
  p result
