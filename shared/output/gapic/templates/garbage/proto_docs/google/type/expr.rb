  module Type
    # Represents an expression text. Example:
    #
    #     title: "User account presence"
    #     description: "Determines whether the request has a user account"
    #     expression: "size(request.user) > 0"
    # @!attribute [rw] expression
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Textual representation of an expression in
    #     Common Expression Language syntax.
    #
    #     The application context of the containing message determines which
    #     well-known feature set of CEL is supported.
    # @!attribute [rw] title
    #   @return [::String]
    #     An optional title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
    #     its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the
    #     expression.
    # @!attribute [rw] description
    #   @return [::String]
    #     An optional description of the expression. This is a longer text which
    #     describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
    # @!attribute [rw] location
    #   @return [::String]
    #     An optional string indicating the location of the expression for error
    #     reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
