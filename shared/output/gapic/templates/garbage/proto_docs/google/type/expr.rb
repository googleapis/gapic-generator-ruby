module Google
  module Type
    # Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL)
    # syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL
    # are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.
    #
    # Example (Comparison):
    #
    #     title: "Summary size limit"
    #     description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
    #     expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"
    #
    # Example (Equality):
    #
    #     title: "Requestor is owner"
    #     description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
    #     expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"
    #
    # Example (Logic):
    #
    #     title: "Public documents"
    #     description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
    #     expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"
    #
    # Example (Data Manipulation):
    #
    #     title: "Notification string"
    #     description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
    #     expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"
    #
    # The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression
    # are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service
    # documentation for additional information.
    # @!attribute [rw] expression
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language
    #     syntax.
    # @!attribute [rw] title
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
    #     its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the
    #     expression.
    # @!attribute [rw] description
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which
    #     describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
    # @!attribute [rw] location
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error
    #     reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
