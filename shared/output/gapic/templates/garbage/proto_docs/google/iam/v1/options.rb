      # @!attribute [rw] requested_policy_version
      #   @return [::Integer]
      #     Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the
      #     policy.
      #
      #     Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
      #     rejected.
      #
      #     Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify
      #     version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid
      #     value or leave the field unset.
      #
      #     The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified,
      #     or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version
      #     3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses
      #     version 1.
