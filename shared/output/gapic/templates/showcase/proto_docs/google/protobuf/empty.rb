    # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
    # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
    # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
    #
    #     service Foo {
    #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
    #     }
    #
    # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
