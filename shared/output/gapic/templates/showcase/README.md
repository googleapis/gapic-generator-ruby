## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.7+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Older versions of Ruby _may_
still work, but are unsupported and not recommended. See
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details about the Ruby
support schedule.
