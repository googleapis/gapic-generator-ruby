      # This service is used showcase the four main types of rpcs - unary, server
      # side streaming, client side streaming, and bidirectional streaming. This
      # service also exposes methods that explicitly implement server delay, and
      # paginated calls. Set the 'showcase-trailer' metadata key on any method
      # to have the values echoed in the response trailers.
