      # This service is used to test that GAPICs implement various REST-related features correctly. This mostly means transcoding proto3 requests to REST format
      # correctly for various types of HTTP annotations, but it also includes verifying that unknown (numeric) enums received by clients can be round-tripped
      # correctly.
