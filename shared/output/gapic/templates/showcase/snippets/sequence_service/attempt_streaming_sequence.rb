# Snippet for the attempt_streaming_sequence call in the SequenceService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Showcase::V1beta1::SequenceService::Client#attempt_streaming_sequence.
#
def attempt_streaming_sequence
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Showcase::V1beta1::SequenceService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Showcase::V1beta1::AttemptStreamingSequenceRequest.new

  # Call the attempt_streaming_sequence method to start streaming.
  output = client.attempt_streaming_sequence request

  # The returned object is a streamed enumerable yielding elements of type
  # ::Google::Showcase::V1beta1::AttemptStreamingSequenceResponse
  output.each do |current_response|
    p current_response
  end
