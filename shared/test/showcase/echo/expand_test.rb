  ##
  # Testing expand method with error in REST.
  # Its behavior is different from gRPC for Showcase.
  #
  # This test captures a 'stream cut in the middle' behavior.
  # It might be just showcase-rest specific or might be seen somewhere else.
  # It happens when the REST stream ends and there is something left unparsed in the
  # content buffer.
  # This is how it looks in this specific showcase test.
  # The `---` lines separate JSON chunks as they come in from the stream, so there are 3
  # last chunks of a particular stream in this example.
  # The stream is a JSON array of element messages with two fields: `content`
  # and `severity`.
  # At the beginning of the fragment the previous-to-the-last object ends, and the new
  # object begins with the content of `"vow."`. But its `severity` gets mangled by a server-side
  # error. Therefore it remains unparsed in the parsing buffer, and when the HTTP stream ends
  # the parser throws the `Gapic::Common::Error`.
