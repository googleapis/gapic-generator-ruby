      # Service that implements Google Cloud Speech API.
      #
      # @param version [Symbol, String]
      #   The major version of the service to be used. By default :v1
      #   is used.
      # @overload new(version:, credentials:, scopes:, client_config:, timeout:)
      #   @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash,
      #     GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
      #     Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
      #     be many types.
      #     A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
      #     authenticating requests made by this client.
      #     A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #     credentials for this client.
      #     A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #     credentials for this client.
      #     A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
      #     A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
      #     should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
      #     A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
      #     metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
      #   @param scopes [Array<String>]
      #     The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
      #     an updater_proc is supplied.
      #   @param client_config [Hash]
      #     A Hash for call options for each method. See
      #     Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
      #     this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
      #     or the specified config is missing data points.
      #   @param timeout [Numeric]
      #     The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
      #   @param metadata [Hash]
      #     Default metadata to be sent with each request. This can be overridden on a per call basis.
      #   @param exception_transformer [Proc]
      #     An optional proc that intercepts any exceptions raised during an API call to inject
      #     custom error handling.
