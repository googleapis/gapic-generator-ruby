    # Gapic gRPC Stub
    #
    # This class wraps the actual gRPC Stub object and it's RPC methods.
    #
    # @!attribute [r] grpc_stub
    #   @return [Object] The instance of the gRPC stub class (`grpc_stub_class`) constructor argument.
    #
    class Stub
      attr_reader :grpc_stub

      ##
      # Creates a Gapic gRPC stub object.
      #
      # @param grpc_stub_class [Class] gRPC stub class to create a new instance of.
      # @param endpoint [String] The endpoint of the API.
      # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, Signet::OAuth2::Client, String, Hash, Proc,
      #   GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials] Provides the means for authenticating requests made by
      #   the client. This parameter can be many types:
      #
      #   * A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for authenticating requests
      #     made by this client.
      #   * A `Signet::OAuth2::Client` object used to apply the OAuth credentials.
      #   * A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
      #   * A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials should
      #     already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
      #   * A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the metadata for
      #     requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
      # @param channel_args [Hash] The channel arguments. (This argument is ignored when `credentials` is
      #     provided as a `GRPC::Core::Channel`.)
      # @param interceptors [Array<GRPC::ClientInterceptor>] An array of {GRPC::ClientInterceptor} objects that will
      #   be used for intercepting calls before they are executed Interceptors are an EXPERIMENTAL API.
      #

      ##
      # Invoke the specified API call.
      #
      # @param method_name [Symbol] The RPC method name.
      # @param request [Object] The request object.
      # @param options [ApiCall::Options, Hash] The options for making the API call. A Hash can be provided to
      #   customize the options object, using keys that match the arguments for {ApiCall::Options.new}. This object
      #   should only be used once.
      # @param format_response [Proc] A Proc object to format the response object. The Proc should accept response as
      #   an argument, and return a formatted response object. Optional.
      #
      #   If `stream_callback` is also provided, the response argument will be an Enumerable of the responses.
      #   Returning a lazy enumerable that adds the desired formatting is recommended.
      # @param operation_callback [Proc] A Proc object to provide a callback of the response and operation objects.
      #   The response will be formatted with `format_response` if that is also provided. Optional.
      # @param stream_callback [Proc] A Proc object to provide a callback for every streamed response received. The
      #   Proc will be called with the response object. Should only be used on Bidi and Server streaming RPC calls.
      #   Optional.
      #
      # @return [Object, Thread] The response object. Or, when `stream_callback` is provided, a thread running the
      #   callback for every streamed response is returned.
